# Plastic-Waste-Segregation-using-DL
Plastic Waste Segregation Using Deep Learning
This project aims to automate the segregation of plastic waste using deep learning models, enhancing recycling efficiency and reducing environmental impact. By analyzing images of waste, the system classifies plastic into various types for proper disposal or recycling.

Key Features 
Image Classification: Identifies and categorizes plastic waste into different types (e.g.,  PET, HDPE, LDPE). 
Deep Learning Models: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for  feature extraction and classification.   
Dataset: Trained on a labeled dataset of plastic waste images. 
Accuracy Optimization: Fine-tunes the model using techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning. 
Deployment: Can be integrated into waste management systems via a mobile or web application.

Technology Stack   
Frameworks: TensorFlow / PyTorch. 
Languages: Python.
Tools: OpenCV for image preprocessing, Matplotlib for visualization. 
Hardware: Optional GPU acceleration for faster training. 

Applications   
Recycling centers.
Smart waste bins.
Environmental monitoring systems.
